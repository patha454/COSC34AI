phase_one.py
This is the script for the first phase of the bot's operation.
phase_one will drive the bot forward over black and white tiles, for a count of
15 black tiles.

After passing 15 black tiles, the bot will turn ninety degrease right and
return control to the caller, ready for the next phase.

This version uses a new algorithm, as the algorithm used up to V3 was found
Unreliable in testing.
